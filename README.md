# FunSet Enrichment Visualization frontend

The FunSet webserver performs Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, identifying GO terms that are statistically overrepresented in a target set with respect to a background set. The enriched terms are displayed in a 2D plot that captures the semantic similarity between terms, with the option to cluster the terms and identify a representative term for each cluster. FunSet can be used interactively or programmatically, and allows users to download the enrichment results both in tabular form and in graphical form as SVG files or in data format as JSON.

This is the `client-side` portion of FunSet.
